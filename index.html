    <p style="text-align: center;">Hi! Welcome to my MScBMC Blog for the MSC2006H Media Design Course.</p>


    <h2>01 My MRP</h2>
    <p>I am creating a 2D/3D animation on navigating women's sexual health after radiation cancer treatment for a virtual sexual health clinic. The animation focuses on what radiation is, what effects it can have on your body and how that impacts your sexual health, and what management strategies you can do. The style is minimalistic and warm, with focus on engaging animation transitions and patient inclusivity.</p>
    

    <h2>02 What I Want to Learn</h2> 
    <p>I am new in the interactive world, so my goal is to learn the basics of website building, familarize myself with the basic language and get an introduction of coding. Since my MRP is part of the animation stream, I was maybe thinking of creating a version of my animation that is a scrolly telly, where users can click for additional information at certain parts. I also want to learn how to intergrate a 3D asset and videos into a website.</p>


    <h2>03 Course Reflections</h2>

    <h3>Class 1</h3>
    <p>It was great to learn the basic terms that you hear about, but don't really understand (like html and css), and get introduced to GitHub. Everything is so new to me and I have no background whatsover, so the recorded videos truly helped (especially because I was unable to make the first class).</p>

    <h3>Class 2</h3>
    <p>I was a little lost as I missed the first class, and at that point did not review the class 1 videos. But even so, I learned a great deal and it was fun to follow along in Figma. I had no idea Figma could be linked to creating a website.</p>
